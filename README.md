# My Implementation of Some of the Standard C Library Functions

**What is libft?**
Libft is an individual project at 42 that requires us to re-create some standard C library functions, including some additional ones. These functions serve as building blocks for creating a library of useful functions to be used throughout the rest of the program.

*Disclaimer*: The objective is not to reinvent the wheel, but to gain a deeper understanding of data structures and basic algorithms. At 42, we are not allowed to use certain standard libraries in our projects, so we progressively expand this library with our own functions as we advance in the program.

**What's in it?**
Here are some of the functions implemented in libft:

- ft_bzero.c
- ft_memcpy.c
- ft_striteri.c
- ft_memmove.c
- ft_memchr.c
- ft_memcmp.c
- ft_strlen.c
- ft_strlcpy.c
- ft_strlcat.c
- ft_strchr.c
- ft_strrchr.c
- ft_strnstr.c
- ft_strncmp.c
- ft_itoa.c
- ft_isalpha.c
- ft_isdigit.c
- ft_isalnum.c
- ft_isascii.c
- ft_isprint.c
- ft_toupper.c
- ft_tolower.c
- ft_strdup.c
- ft_substr.c
- ft_strtrim.c
- ft_strjoin.c
- ft_memset.c
- ft_atoi.c
- ft_calloc.c
- ft_strnstr.c
- ft_putchar_fd.c
- ft_putstr_fd.c
- ft_putendl_fd.c
- ft_putnbr_fd.c
- ft_strmapi.c
- ft_split.c

**Makefile and libft**
The Makefile is used to compile the libft functions and manage the project's build process. The names of most files and functions are namespaced with 'ft' in front, which stands for "Forty-Two," the distinctive style used at 42.
